He was born on August 23, 1978, and died on January 26, 2020. Kobe Bryant was drafted to the NBA in 1996 in round one and pick 13 to the CharlotteHornets then immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. On Nov. 3, 1996, was his first NBA game and he was only 18 years, 72 days old he was the youngest player to ever appear in an NBA game. While Kobe didn't have much of an impact in his first game with the Lakers, he went on to average 7.6 points, 1.3 assists and 1.9 rebounds.1996-97 This was the beginning of the Kobe Bryant era in the NBA. In his rookie campaign, Kobe averaged seven points in 15 minutes of action per game. Kobe was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team, in addition to winning the NBA Slam Dunk Contest at All-Star Weekend. Kobe did exhibit some growing pains, however. In-Game 5 of the conference semifinals against the Utah Jazz, Kobe famously shot numerous airballs in overtime, sealing the series victory for Utah. In  1997-98 Kobe Bryant had much more of an impact for the Los Angeles Lakers in his second season with the team. Kobe doubled his scoring average from the previous season, averaging 15 points a game as the team’s top reserve. In the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season, Kobe Bryant became a full-time starter for the Los Angeles Lakers. Kobe averaged 19 points a contest en route to being named to the All-NBA Third Team. By now, Kobe Bryant was well on his way to becoming one of the game’s best players. Kobe saw his scoring average climb to 22 points a game, as the Los Angeles Lakers won their first championship since 1988. Kobe had moments in the playoffs showing that he was not only talented but also clutch. In-Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, Kobe scored 25 points with 11 rebounds, seven assists, and four blocks. Kobe continued to shine in the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers. After missing Game 3 of the series with an ankle injury, Kobe came up huge for the Lakers in Game 4. With Shaquille O’Neal fouling out of the game in overtime, Kobe hit numerous clutch baskets to give the Lakers a 3-1 series advantage. Kobe ended the season being named to the All-NBA Second Team and All-Defensive First Team. Kobe Bryant averaged 28 points a game in 2000-2001, which was good enough for fourth-best in the NBA. Kobe also had a very impressive run in the playoffs, averaging 29 points, six assists and seven rebounds per game, which included a 33-point average against the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference finals. The Lakers cruised to their second straight championship, losing only one playoff game in the process. The 2001-2002 season saw the Los Angeles Lakers win their third consecutive championship. While Kobe Bryant’s regular season and postseason scoring both decreased from the previous season, he was named to his first All-NBA First Team. Kobe also took home the All-Star Game MVP. That year’s game was held in Philadelphia. Kobe, who grew up near Philadelphia, was booed by his Pennsylvanian brethren as he accepted the award.
