      <small> <small>Although the Los Angeles Lakers failed to win their fourth consecutive championship, Kobe had one of his best seasons in 2002-03, yielding serious debates as to whether he had replaced Shaquille O’Neal as the team’s best player. Kobe ranked second in the league in scoring, averaging a team-best 30 points a game. Additionally, Kobe had one of the most impressive scoring stretches in league history. Kobe had nine consecutive games of at least 40 points and averaged 40.6 points a game in February. After the Los Angeles Lakers added Gary Payton and Karl Malone in the summer of 2003, Kobe’s overall production dropped from previous seasons to accommodate playing with his two new teammates. The Lakers made it to the NBA Finals for the fourth time in five years, but the Detroit Pistons shockingly upset them in five games. Nonetheless, Kobe made his third straight All-NBA First Team and second consecutive All-Defensive First Team. Following the 2004 season, Shaquille O’Neal was traded and Phil Jackson temporarily retired, leading to an underwhelming 2004-05 season for both the Los Angeles Lakers and Kobe Bryant. Kobe missed 16 games, and the Los Angeles Lakers failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 1993-94. It wasn’t a good start for Kobe in his attempt to lead the Lakers as the team’s alpha dog. Kobe Bryant backed up his disappointing '04-05 season with arguably one of the most impressive seasons in league history. Kobe won his first scoring title, averaging 35 points a game, which included his famous 81-point performance (55 of which came in the second half) against the Toronto Raptors. Kobe had an equally impressive game earlier in the season when he scored 62 points in just three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Kobe led the Lakers to 45 wins, which is saying something considering the supporting cast he played with, and a near upset of the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs. It was a total travesty he didn’t win the MVP award. Instead, Steve Nash won his second consecutive MVP after leading the Phoenix Suns to 54 wins with Amare Stoudemire missing the majority of the season. Some like to argue Kobe’s gaudy numbers that season was because he was selfish and didn’t bother getting his teammates involved. People say that as though he had an All-Star cast playing alongside him. Lamar Odom was the only quality teammate he had that season. Kobe Bryant averaged 31 points per game in 2006-07, earning his second consecutive scoring title. But the season proved to be reminiscent of '05-06 with Kobe trying to singlehandedly lead the team back to relevancy. The Lakers barely made the playoffs and were embarrassed by the Phoenix Suns in the first round. One of the few bright spots was Kobe winning the All-Star Game MVP for the second time in his career. Kobe Bryant won his first MVP award in 2008, averaging 28 points, six rebounds and five assists a game. Kobe led the Lakers to the best record in the Western Conference, although the acquisition of Pau Gasol midway through the season didn’t hurt either. While I was happy Kobe won the award, it’s hard to take the MVP voting seriously when his 2007-08 season is deemed MVP-worthy but not the amazing season he had in 2005-06. 2008-09 was easily one of Kobe Bryant’s most impressive seasons. Coming off their loss to the Boston Celtics in the 2008 NBA Finals, the Lakers’ toughness was questioned, in addition to speculation about Kobe’s ability to lead the team to a championship. Kobe temporarily silenced his critics, leading the team to its first championship since 2002, proving he could indeed win the big one without Shaq. Kobe Bryant led the Los Angeles Lakers to back-to-back championships, winning his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. The Lakers defeated the Boston Celtics in seven games, getting revenge for their loss to the Celtics in the 2008 finals. Given his five championships and numerous individual achievements, Kobe entered the 2010-11 season gaining steam as being considered as one of the all-time greats. In the middle of the 2010-11 season, Kobe climbed to No. 6 on the all-time scoring list. The Lakers came up short in their bid for three straight championships, losing to the Dallas Mavericks in the conference semifinals. Given Kobe’s age and nagging injuries, there were more “is he getting too old” discussions amongst fans and analysts during the 2010-2011 season. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Kobe was named to his ninth career All-NBA First Team and ninth career All-Defensive First Team and won his fourth All-Star Game MVP award.</small> <a href="https://jgthms.com"></a>   <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"></a><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"></a>.
